# NYT Top Stories

### Solo Project

## Overview

Using an API provided by the New York Times I was able to create an app which shows the NYT's top stories. The landing page shows the title of the article with a photo. If you click on the title you will go to a page which shows more details of just the one article. On this detail page there is a link to go straight to the article on the NYT website. Additionally the user can filter the articles by section, by simply clicking on one of the buttons at the top.



## React

- This multi page App with React was an exercise for me to learn and grow my knowledge of interacting with endpoints that were created from the API.

## Local Set-Up Instructions

### follow these steps to start the app:

- From the repo click the code button and copy the SSH link.
- Open terminal by pressing command + space bar, and search for terminal
- Inside of your terminal type `git clone` and then paste the ssh link. It should look like this: `git clone https://github.com/Wperricone/nyt-front-2.git`
- In your terminal type `cd nyt-front-2`
- Type `npm install`
- Do not run `npm audit fix --force`
- Then type `npm start` This runs the app in the development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- The browser should then deploy using a local host


- NOTE: Make sure that you type `Control + C` in your terminal when you are done using the application. This ensure the server will stop running before your close your Terminal.
